Voluntra is a mobile app that offers students opportunities to volunteer with local organizations. In our community, finding ways to give back has been extremely difficult, our app was created to solve this problem. Honestly, we're proud of some of the things we've managed to accomplish, offering students:

- **Convenience.** Voluntra makes it extremely easy to discover and explore opportunities through algorithmic searching.
- **Quality of Life.** Automatically integrate [`Xello`](https://www.xello.world), so you never have to manually update your listings again.
- **Notifications.** Users can opt-in to be sent a push notification whenever a new shift opens, helping them achieve their goals.
- **Tracking.** Set goals and allow Voluntra to manage everything, offering you opportunities whenever possible.
